# Gmail Genie: Easy Win Improvements for Inbox Management

## 1. Smart Batch Operations
- **Batch API calls**: Modify `archive_emails()` and create `delete_messages()` to use Gmail's batch API for processing multiple messages at once (up to 100 per batch)
- **Bulk actions UI**: Add `--dry-run` flag to preview all actions before executing, with summary counts by action type
- **Undo capability**: Store last batch of actions with message IDs and original labels for quick reversal

## 2. Advanced Filtering & Rules
- **Sender frequency analysis**: Add rule type to auto-archive emails from senders who email more than X times per day/week
- **Time-based rules**: Archive emails older than X days that match certain criteria (e.g., newsletters, promotions)
- **Subject pattern matching**: Add regex support for subject line rules (e.g., auto-archive "[JIRA]", "[GitHub]" notifications)
- **Size-based filtering**: Auto-flag or archive emails with large attachments (>10MB)
- **Thread management**: Option to archive entire threads when any message matches a rule

## 3. Smart Label Management
- **Auto-labeling**: Use the unused rule fields (`label_from_not_important`, `from_address_auto_label`) to automatically apply labels
- **Label creation**: Create missing labels on-the-fly based on rules
- **Category enhancement**: Use Gmail's category predictions (Promotions, Social, Updates) as additional filter criteria
- **Nested labels**: Support hierarchical label structures (e.g., "Work/Projects/ProjectA")

## 4. Intelligent Unsubscribe Assistant
- **List-Unsubscribe header**: Parse and display unsubscribe links from email headers
- **Unsubscribe patterns**: Detect common unsubscribe link patterns in email body
- **Frequency tracking**: Track which senders you never open emails from and suggest unsubscribe
- **One-click unsubscribe list**: Generate a report of all subscription emails with direct unsubscribe actions

## 5. Email Analytics & Insights
- **Daily/weekly digest**: Show statistics on emails processed, time saved, inbox reduction percentage
- **Sender analytics**: Top 10 senders by volume, which you can then create rules for
- **Response time tracking**: Identify emails that typically require responses vs. those that don't
- **Peak hours analysis**: Show when most emails arrive to optimize processing schedule

## 6. Priority & Smart Sorting
- **Important markers**: Use Gmail's importance markers to prioritize processing
- **Star patterns**: Support different star types for different action priorities
- **People-first mode**: Process emails from real people before automated emails
- **VIP list**: Never auto-process emails from specific important contacts

## 7. Content-Based Intelligence
- **Attachment handling**: Special rules for emails with attachments (invoices, documents)
- **Calendar integration**: Detect meeting invites and handle differently
- **Transaction detection**: Identify receipts, order confirmations for special handling
- **Newsletter grouping**: Group similar newsletters together for batch review

## 8. Enhanced Search & Filters
- **Multi-condition rules**: Support AND/OR logic in rules (e.g., from X domain AND has attachment)
- **Negative filters**: Support "NOT" conditions (e.g., archive all EXCEPT from these senders)
- **Custom search operators**: Create shortcuts for complex Gmail searches
- **Saved searches**: Store and reuse complex query combinations

## 9. Performance & Efficiency
- **Incremental processing**: Track last processed message to avoid re-scanning
- **Parallel processing**: Process multiple rules concurrently for faster execution
- **Caching**: Cache label mappings, sender frequencies for faster subsequent runs
- **Selective fetch**: Only fetch message parts needed for rules (headers vs. full body)

## 10. User Experience
- **Interactive mode**: Add `--interactive` flag to review and confirm each action
- **Rule testing**: Test rules against recent emails without executing actions
- **Configuration wizard**: Interactive setup for creating rules based on current inbox
- **Export/Import rules**: Share rule sets between accounts or users
